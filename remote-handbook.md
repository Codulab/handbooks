### Working Flexibly, Working Remotely, Working Smartly

We’ve put together this guide to make sure everyone is aware of and understands
the expectations around **flexible working hours** and **remote working**. This
document does not supersede your employment contract, it’s here to help you get
shit done, wherever you choose to do it.

We’re always open to feedback and to evolve how we work to improve productivity.

## Flexible Working Hours

### First, Let’s Talk About Flexible Working Hours

Remember, Flexi-time is not Remote working.

We know life can get hectic and sometimes you need to go to the bank or leave
early to beat the traffic. We have flexible working hours to let you manage
your day so that your work time can be focussed and productive.

#### Over-communicate

Take responsibility to make sure the team knows if you’re going to come in late
(after 9:00) or leave early (before 5:00pm). You need to notify fellow
colleagues involved in the projects that may be affected or your lead mentor
and Product Owner.

#### Productivity is king

Flexible working hours are available to everyone so long as you’re getting your
work done.  Remember that it’s designed to maximise productivity and minimise
distractions and wasted time.

## Working Remotely: An Introduction

We understand that sometimes the best place to get work done is not the office,
especially when you need uninterrupted concentration time. We also trust you to
make productive use of your time when working out of the office. We do however
have some expectations for those of you who choose to work remotely.

### What it is and isn’t

**Working remotely is different to working flexi-time.** Remote working means
that for the agreed period your office desk is off site. You are however
expected to be at your desk (wherever or whatever that is) working, accessible
and delivering as you would, were you in the office.

### How your job role affects remote working

**There’s no one size fits all.** Every one of us fulfills a different role in
the team and will require different levels of team face to face or client
interaction. This means that remote working will be practically implemented
differently with each team member.

### Who can work remotely

**Short answer – Anyone.** Remote working is available to everyone on the
staff. However, how often you can work remotely depends on your job role, the
projects you’re working on and the phase of the project the team is currently
in.

## Working Remotely: Expectations

### Over-communicate

- As you would with flexi-time, do the same when remote working.
- Make sure you communicate what you plan to do and what you’ve got done.

### Productivity

- Make sure you understand and have set deliverables for the project you’re
  working on. Ticking off things on the to do list makes it a lot easier for
  you to communicate your productivity.
- If there aren’t clear deliverables for the work you’re busy with, speak to
  your team lead or set your own and share with your project leader.

### Responsibility

- It’s your responsibility to ensure that the team knows what you’re doing,
  where you’re doing it and why you’re doing it.
- If we have a sprint or project catch up at the office it’s important that
  you’re at the office – if you aren’t then you have to get approval beforehand
  and be available for any video catch ups if need be.

## Things you’ll need to work remotely

### Upfront Approval

- We’re not big on bureaucracy, but we do want notice at least the day before
  (Before lunch) working remotely. ie.: If you want to work remotely on
  Wednesday you need to let us know before lunchtime on Tuesday.
- You need to get approval from your project manager.

### Known Availability

- If you’re not going to be working the hours you normally work, over
  communicate this to the team by posting in Slack (e.g. “Going to the gym for
  an hour”).
- Nothing is more frustrating to team productivity than chat messages like “Has
  anyone seen X?” “When is X getting online?” “Can someone else take this bug?
  X isn’t responding.”
- Try not to pop in and out. Work sustained sessions with only a few
  significant interruptions (e.g., lunch, light walking, gym).

### A Proper Place To Work

- This means somewhere with a proper chair and desk. Preferably a room where
  you can close the door and get work done without disruptions. Remote working
  isn’t there so you can multitask ie: move and code, paint a deck and write
  a screenplay. Take leave for that.
- No child care responsibilities during working hours. You can’t take care of
  kids and work at the same time. For some of you this refers to Fiffie the
  poodle.

### A Computer With Everything You Need

- Make sure you have the tools you need; your charger, the software, the code
  base, etc.
- Access to Slack.
- Webcam and able to connect to whatever video chat the team want to use. This
  will usually be shared via Slack.

### A Decent Internet Connection

- You’ll need an internet connection that can handle uploading and downloading
  of the files you need, as well as being able to handle Slack and Skype.
- You cannot work remotely on code without access to internet.

### You & Your Work Must Be Available To Your Team

- Make sure all your code is committed on GitLab, Bitbucket or your work is in Google
  Docs. Make sure the files you’ve been working on are available to other team
  members.
- Should we need to contact you, you must be contactable.

### Have Boundaries

The people you’re going to be around might not understand that you’re working
at home and yes, you will actually be working. Make sure you set the right
expectations with your spouse, girlfriend, flat-mate, kids, Mother in Law, etc.

### Pants

Pants are optional. Just don’t get arrested. If you’re about to get arrested
remember to commit that code :-)
