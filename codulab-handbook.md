## Welcome

This is a company handbook to help you understand more about us, how we work and think. It can be daunting when changing jobs, working with new partner companies or starting a career, so we think this will help you settle in quicker and answer quite a few questions that we may assume you already know.

Just like everything we create, this is a collaborative living doc that will keep growing. So feel free to add questions and suggestions.

## Your First Day

### The Office

Make yourself comfy. You can sit wherever.

### Getting Setup

You should have invitations to all our cloud based software waiting for you in your inbox.

## What We Do

> We build online products for people and businesses around the world to use.

The best way to grow your business is to add value to people’s lives. Sometimes those people are staff, using shitty software every day to do their job. Sometimes those people are customers, trying to get something done so they can get on with their lives.

Whether we’re designing for an audience of 5 users or 40,000 unique users a month we have the same intent – make something that’s useful and elegant.

## How We Think

### No Titles

We’re not big on hierarchy. Everyone has a different and unique role to play in a project. Managing a team and this company is a role, not a _position_.

Some of us have titles in our email signatures, but that’s for the benefit of the client more than an indication of importance.

### We. Not Me.

We care about what is right, not who is right. You’ll very quickly come to find that ideas, input, questions are welcome and encouraged here at every level.

We collectively make decisions, give input and share. So when we talk about an idea it comes from ’us’ and ’we’ – it’s not a thought or product from ’me’.

When we disagree we _defer_ to people in teams who are better equipped than us. That’s where _roles_ become useful. If we hired you to design, you’ll get the final word on design.

### The client is part of the team

Remember that the client is also part of the team and their opinion is as valuable as ours. After all they work in their industry everyday and have a very different set of skills and experience.

We may joke from time to time about feedback or briefs, but that’s because we live in a different world and sometimes we use different language and think differently, but don’t confuse that with us not respecting their opinions and expecting the same from them.

### Debate. Challenge. Ask.

If you have a question – ask.

If you’re confused – say so.

If it doesn’t make any sense – tell us…

We welcome questions and discussion – the more debate the better the solution.

We want to have a culture where it’s possible to challenge ideas without attacking. 

### We’ve Got Your Back!

We’re a team and that means we always have each other’s backs. It means we’re in it together.

As a company we’re always honest when we make a mistake or under-estimate delivery, but we never single out someone – we take it as a team.

So if you under-estimated a deadline or scope of work – don’t keep it to yourself and try to put in a few sleepless nights of work – speak up – the quicker you share info the quicker we can manage it and help.

If you really think you can help someone – be honest – tell them how or what. Good friends are honest. Be prepared to be challenged and appreciate it.

If something outside of work is affecting you tell us – if it’s ok with you. We don’t hold hands and ask you to share your feelings, but we appreciate honesty about anything that could help us help you be happier at work.

### Proactively Solving problems

Have an idea? Make it happen.

Been given a task? Take responsibility for it.

Get involved beyond your “Scope of work”. We want developers to question strategy, designers to question code.

Proactivity is one of our greatest strengths at Codulab. The ability to keep moving and make things happen.

You’ll also hear us talk about having a bias towards building products. Our aim is always towards making something to test our assumptions. The sooner we can prototype ideas the better.

> A prototype is worth a thousand meetings.

### No Babysitters

We’re all adults, so expect to be treated like one – we won’t babysit you, we won’t constantly check up on you.

If you’re given a task, the default expectation is that you’re working to get it done asap. The p part of that is important – we only expect what’s possible.

We expect you to be able to ask questions and make decisions and share those, not just blindly do what you’re asked to.

If you need to be managed then make sure the product owner and project manager knows that so we can help you by increasing reminders and update intervals.

### Meetings

Meetings are great, when they’re needed. But a lot of the time they’re a waste of time. So we hardly ever have them.

Meetings are important and useful when they are planned for and run properly.

Before setting a meeting consider if we absolutely need to have it to solve the problem, only invite essential people, be well prepped, set the agenda so that everyone knows what it’s about, and then run it efficiently

Face-time is important so we have a Monday catch up as a team, because that helps us connect and share updates face to face. It’s important for us to all feel connected on a personal level, but at the same time respect everyone’s time and preferred working style.

We also run weekly project meetings on Monday. For many of you that will be the only meeting you ever experience. I know, right.

### Have fun

No-one is watching you sweat, no one wants you to sweat. All we ask is that you create the best work you can and have fun doing it.

As Aaron Marshall puts it – Go Big _and_ Go Home.

If you don’t love what you’re working on – tell us – this doesn’t mean that there are small things we all dread doing, but the overall work must be something you take pride in, something that is growing and showcasing your craft.

If you’re not having fun and you have some suggestions how we can fix that then speak to us – share it with team. Instead of complaining – help fix it.

## How We Work

### Tools

We’re always looking at ways of improving how we can work more effectively, more collaboratively, so our toolset is constantly changing.

#### Slack

Slack is the artery of our workflow. All of our tooling is integrated into slack, so in a real sense, everything happens there. We talk about work, we talk crap, we share work in progress we share stupid links. If you’re on Slack, you’re in the office.

#### Google Apps

We use google for all of our docs, spreadsheets, presentations and asset storage. We encourage you to have all your working files backed up by using Google Sync. Because shit happens.

#### GitHub, GitLab & Bitbucket

If you’re not writing code, you’ll experience [GitHub][1] as a project management tool. You’ll get issues assigned to you, which you close when completed. We’ll cover this more in Sprints.

#### Trello

For anything that _doesn’t_ have a repository in GitHub, GitLab and Bitbuckte, we have a Codulab Trello account so that we can assign tasks to people across the organisation. You can use it however you want to.

#### Design Tools

We have a more exhaustive list of design tools we use and recommend in our [designer’s handbook][2].

#### Developer Tools

Developer specific tooling is covered in detail in the [developer’s handbook][3].

### Weeklies

Weeklies are one of the very few meetings we have where we review work done / not done in the previous sprint, and talk about the objectives for the next sprint. We really need all hands on deck at these.

* A Weekly marks the end of a sprint and beginning of the next sprint
* We typically have a weekly for each client or for a project if its big enough


## Remote Working and Flexi Time

At the end of the day, what really matters is what gets made, not where it gets made. Because we want you to make awesome stuff, and lots of it, we’re structured for both office-based and remote working. Work from the sanctity of your home where pants are optional. Or, work from Codulab office. Whether it’s our place, your place or any place – we’ll let you work wherever you get work done.

Remote working is kind of a new thing for many people who join us, so we wrote a separate [handbook][6] for that.

## Your Growth

We want everyone who works with us to be wealthy, contented and growing in every sense of the word. We’re invested in our team’s growth as people, employees and professionals. We do regular catch-ups and reviews – we will do whatever we can to help you be the best professional you can be. 

## Contributing

### This is Your Company. This is Your Book.
